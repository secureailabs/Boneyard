            <h3>Senior Software Architect</h3>
            <h5>Full Time; Cambridge, MA</h5>
            <br>
            <p class="job-listing-para">Secure AI Labs (SAIL) has built and patented a new secure analytics platform that allows healthcare and life science companies to share valuable, sensitive data while maintaining ownership and privacy. SAIL is building a securely accessible network that integrates with existing data silos. Machine learning models are able to be trained and run on the network across isolated data sets.</p>
            <p class="job-listing-para">We combine secure computation technology with decentralized machine learning to increase the accuracy and speed of analytics for patients and healthcare providers. SAIL's customers are training algorithms on encrypted health records and encrypted drug libraries, ensuring data ownership and privacy without compromising the computational speed and accuracy necessary for medical research.</p>
            <p class="job-listing-para">Weâ€™re a pre-seed startup with 3 major pilots underway, so this role has high potential for growth within the company. The ideal candidate will: help architect our platform for longevity and robustness, manage our other engineers as we implement features, and bring fresh eyes to security vulnerabilities we should protect against. Qualified candidates should have at least 4 years of experience managing and maintaining platform development. A strong knowledge of relational databases, C, distributed networks, and security/cryptography/encryption is necessary.</p>
