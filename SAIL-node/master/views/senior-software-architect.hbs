              <p class="job-listing-para">Secure AI Labs (SAIL) has built and patented a new secure analytics platform
                  that allows businesses to collaborate with valuable or sensitive datasets while maintaining data
                  ownership and privacy. We combine secure computation technology with a decentralized architecture
                  to increase the accuracy and speed of our analytics. SAILâ€™s customers are performing highly-sensitive
                  analysis on encrypted dataset, like health records and genomic libraries, ensuring data ownership
                  and privacy without compromising computational speed and accuracy.
