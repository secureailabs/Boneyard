##model file generation 
1.download GWAS summary statistics 
2.standardise the GWAS summary statistics into format that can be used by Plink((GWASsumProcess.R))
3. Use Plink tool LD clump function to deal with LD in summary statistics using 1000 genome project data as genotypes (LDClumping.sh)
4. Generate GWAS JSON file using the processed GWAS summary statistics data and baseline risk data obtained from literature (Generate_GWAS_JSON_file.R)


## data file 

1.convert raw 23andMe data into VCF format based on hg19 reference 
2. Impute missed SNPS （choose not to impute yet）
3.convert the VCF file into simplified JSON format (CMD_PatientDataIntoJSON5.R)
Rscript CMD_PatientDataIntoJSON5.R [PatientID] [VCF file address] [OutputAddress]



##Prediction-method 
1. 

The final predicted polygenic score will be in txt in output address defined in C file (C code folder).
